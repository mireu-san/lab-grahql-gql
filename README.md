# Test log of Graphql (GQL) 

- To run, 'node index' <CAUTION: client & server need to be start in separate terminal. (1) start 'node index' from server directory. (2) run 'npm stsart' in client side where installed react. Otherwise, graphql won't work! >


After npm init, install the following libraries:
- npm install apollo-server graphql
- npm install nodemon

# For client (as react)
- npx create-react-app
- Apollo graphql = npm i @apollo/client
